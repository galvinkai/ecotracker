## EcoTracker App Explanation

### Overview
EcoTracker is a sustainable finance application that helps users track and reduce their carbon footprint by analyzing their purchasing decisions. It combines financial tracking with environmental impact assessment to promote more sustainable consumer choices.

### Core Features

**1. Carbon Footprint Dashboard**

**2. Transaction Tracking with Environmental Impact**
- Records user purchases and automatically calculates their carbon footprint
- Categorizes transactions by material type (Cotton, Glass, Petroleum Products, Plastic, Steel, Timber, Wheat)
- Assigns impact levels to each transaction based on carbon emission calculations
- Preserves transaction history for progress tracking

**3. Carbon Trend Visualization**
- Charts carbon footprint over time (monthly breakdown)
- Compares actual footprint against target goals
- Uses area charts with gradient fill for visual appeal
- Includes fallback data generation for first-time users

**4. AI-Powered Insights and Recommendations**
- Provides personalized recommendations to reduce environmental impact
- Highlights achievements when users make sustainable choices
- Offers practical tips for more eco-friendly purchasing decisions
- Analyzes spending patterns to suggest alternatives

**5. QR Code Sharing**
- Allows users to share the app with friends and family
- Generates customizable QR codes that link to the application
- Includes offline fallback for QR code generation when server is unavailable
- Supports customization of colors and titles

**6. Offline Functionality**
- Works without internet connection using localStorage for data persistence
- Synchronizes data when connection is restored
- Provides visual indicators when in offline mode
- Generates fallback data when API connections fail

### Technical Implementation

**1. Frontend**
- Built with React and TypeScript for type safety and component reusability
- Uses Recharts for data visualization components
- Implements responsive design for mobile and desktop users
- Features dark mode support for reduced energy consumption and better accessibility

**2. Backend**
- Python Flask server for API endpoints and data processing
- Machine learning model for environmental impact assessment
- QR code generation API with customization options
- Handles both synchronous and asynchronous requests

**3. Data Management**
- Uses localStorage for offline data persistence
- Implements randomization for first-time user experience
- Maintains transaction history with environmental metadata
- Generates fallback data when needed for visualization continuity

### Environmental Impact Calculation

The app calculates carbon footprint based on:
- Material type (different materials have different carbon factors)
- Quantity of material used
- Production process impact
- Transportation considerations
- Waste potential

### User Benefits
